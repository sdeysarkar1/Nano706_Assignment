# üç∑ Wine Quality Classification ‚Äî Machine Learning Models

This project demonstrates **classification of wine quality** using classical ML algorithms in Python.  
The workflow covers visualization, dataset splitting, model training, and performance evaluation.

### üìä Part 1: Visualize the Data
Below is a scatter plot showing the relationship between **Alcohol** and **Malic Acid** concentrations,  
colored by wine quality labels.

### üß© Part 2: Split the Data
The dataset was divided into **training** and **testing** subsets for model evaluation.
‚úÖ Training set size: (124, 13)
‚úÖ Testing set size: (54, 13)


### ü§ñ Part 3: Model Training & Evaluation
Two supervised learning models were implemented:

| Model Type              | Description                                | Accuracy |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|:--------:|
| **Decision Tree**        | Tree-based classifier capturing non-linear patterns | **0.96** |
| **Logistic Regression**  | Linear probabilistic model for classification | **0.98** |






# MNIST Classification + YOLOv5 Detection ‚Äî Results
